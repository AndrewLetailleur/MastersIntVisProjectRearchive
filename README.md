# MastersIntVisProjectRearchive
 A second attempt, at archiving my Serious Game project, for Interactive Visualisations, Master degree, at the Glasgow School of Art

 The created game in general, is programmed and designed, by myself (Andrew Letailleur)
 
 All the models are imported from the "Unity Asset Store"
 All sounds are from Freesound.org
 The controller script, is from my lecturer, "Brian Loranger".
